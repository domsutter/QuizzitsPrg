# QuizGame — Student Edition

This version adds lots of commentary intended for learning:
- **Header blocks** at the top of each file explaining how to read the code.
- **JavaDoc prompts** before each method to nudge you to summarize in your own words.
- **Inline hints** where logic branches, loops, object creation, returns, and exceptions occur.
- **TODOs** sprinkled throughout to encourage experimentation.

## Suggested exercises
1. Add a new `Deck` and a few cards; trace how `QuizManager` stores and loads them.
2. Change a question; run the app; confirm the UI updates.
3. Add a tiny feature (e.g., shuffle deck) and annotate your changes with comments.

> Tip: Try deleting a comment-block and rewriting it yourself as a comprehension check.
